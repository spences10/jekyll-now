# My first Microsoft Visual Studio Code [VSCode] extension

Well that was a bit painful, well not actually I mean from the documentation I feel I was a bit mislead.

So for those of you that know what I do for a living I'm primarily an Analyst Developer with a skill set of VBA and SQL which has put me in good stead for the last 10+ years. I'm currently 'up-skilling' myself on mre general programming languages, but enough of that! I basically wanted to use VSCode with VBA which is fine as it's just text files but I wanted some of the shexy stuff that VSCode comes with.

I'm not going to go into how awesome (I think) VSCode is here but I will mention that for the purpose of me wanting to use (or at least see syntax highlighting) I found this extension for VBScript which was neat but didn't give me any intellisense for even the most straight forward stuff (sub/function) wasn't there.

So that got me playing around with making my own [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/customization/userdefinedsnippets) and I found that after a while I had quite a lot of them so I decided to put them on the VSCode market place.
